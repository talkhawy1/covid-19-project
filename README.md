# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization

This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data, focusing on data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.

## Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions of people worldwide, leading to a significant impact on public health, the economy, and society as a whole. This project uses data collected from various sources to analyze the spread of the disease, the effectiveness of different interventions, and the impact on various populations.

## Data Sources

The following data sources were used for this project:

- Johns Hopkins University (JHU) COVID-19 Data Repository: Provides daily updates on the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries from COVID-19 worldwide.
- World Bank Data: Provides data on key health indicators, including hospital beds per capita, physician density, and healthcare spending.
- Our World in Data: Provides data on COVID-19 vaccinations worldwide, including the number of doses administered and the percentage of the population vaccinated.

## Data Cleaning

The raw data from the above sources were cleaned and processed to ensure consistency and accuracy. The cleaning process included:

- Removing duplicates and missing values
- Standardizing country and region names
- Imputing missing values using appropriate methods

## Data Analysis

The cleaned data were analyzed to provide insights into the following areas:

- The spread of the disease over time and across different regions
- The impact of various interventions on the spread of the disease
- The relationship between COVID-19 cases and deaths, and key health indicators
- The progress of COVID-19 vaccination worldwide

## Data Visualization

The results of the data analysis were visualized using various charts, graphs, and maps to make it easier to understand and interpret. The visualizations include:

- Line charts showing the trend of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries over time
- Maps showing the distribution of COVID-19 cases and deaths across different regions
- Bar charts showing the impact of interventions on the spread of the disease
- Scatter plots showing the relationship between COVID-19 cases and deaths, and key health indicators

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data, focusing on data cleaning, exploration, and visualization. The insights gained from this analysis can help policymakers and healthcare professionals make informed decisions to combat the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate its impact on society.
